I've always wanted to build something for myself with my software engineering skills. I've always
wanted to create a blog. Wordpress has been an option since I was familiar with it from high school, yet it alwasy seemed a little bloated and messy to me (sorry Wordpress devs, I don't mean to belittle the framework, just gotta say it didn't fit me). <br /><br />

I am a front-end software engineer by trade, working with React, MUI etc for 5 years so I am quite tired of them. Can't really see React as anything other than a work-related tool. I would also like to keep my blog as simple as possible. I was definitely looking for a SSG or SSR solution, and Astro seemed like the best choice. I could keep the tech stack as complex or as simple as I wanted. I could use fancy frameworks if needed, but since my blog is a content-driven application I felt that some simple markdown and html templates rendering would do the trick. I love writing Markdown! <br /><br />

I value minimalism and reaching for the lowest-cost and lowest-maintenance solution possible. Until the time for scaling-up comes. I dislike preoptimizations, I consider them bloat. <br/><br/>

> Well, it certainly feels like "bloat" is building up the be one of the overarching themes of this blog

Having a SSG blog, hosted on the free plan of a provider that works with Git deployments feels like a blessing. I can utilize many of software engineering skills I use daily to remove complexity from building the blog, so that I can focus better on creating the content.
