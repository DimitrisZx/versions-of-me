A few weeks ago I've officially completed my first year in mental health counseling training. I would like to present my thoughts and talk about a few things about this first touch with counseling.

I believe I felt right at home with this process right from the first few lessons. I was watching lectures on subjects that I have had researched in the past in my own free time, out of pure interest and curiosity. Schools of psychotherapy, theories of personality, psychoanalysis, existential therapy. It really felt very rewarding and re-affirming to see how at home I've felt since I've had my doubts about this whole getting into mental health thing.

During the first course of the year, we've had to do written, weekly reflections about each lesson and how I've felt about it. This process gave me a solid reason to start noticing myself and writing out my thoughts and feelings. What is more, having someone give feedback on these thoughts really gave me validation and made me feel that my voice could be worth sharing with others. I believe this is mainly what inspired me to do this kind of content with this blog.
