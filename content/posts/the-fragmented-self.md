Well, I gotta admit the title of this post was AI suggested (the irony). However, it captures the vibe of the blog really well and seems fitting for the title of my first post! <br/><br/>

Here I am, a software engineer disillusioned by the tech space and especially by AI and it's influence on it. For many reasons I will elaborate on on upcoming posts I feel like I am kind of burnt out from tech and software in general. It's a fun vocation most of the time and it definitely spins my problem solving gears, but it lacks meaning (I know, how original). <br/><br/>

Meaning seems to be quite important to me but also very elusive. It was one of the reasons I've started attending therapy anyways. No surprise, I haven't found it yet through therapy, but at least I have been more at peace with the lack of meaning the last couple of years. And therapy has opened my eyes to a quite a few things more than just what could be the meaning of life. <br/><br/>

Therapy was a whole new world for me and I really did want to immerse myself in it. Soon I felt the need to experience somehow how it feels to be a therapist, the person on the opposite chair to me. I've read quite a few books by Irvin Yalom, who gives the reader a very authentic and a very personal look into the mind and the process of the therapist. The seeds had been planted. <br/><br/>

Then, during my 2023 Christmas vacation I've had an√ü "aha" moment. I was watching Youtube videos about JavaScript news and suddendly I took a step back and asked myself "who the \* cares about that? Why create so many abstractions, so many tools, one on top of another, to build increasingly complicated versions of the same things? Whose life is improved by yet another JavaScript framework or the hottest library of the week?". <br/><br/>

And then I took a look at the book that lay right beside my tablet and thought to myself "Hell, I've been studying and reading about therapy much more than I am reading about software and technology and still I can't get enough. Why shouldn't I give it go officially? Why shouldn't I train to become a therapist myself?". And from now on my self was "fragmented", let's say. Between the world of technology and the world of the psyche. A very very symbolic split for me too. <br/><br/>

Technology symbolized all my struggles for efficiency, for more, for better, faster, harder, stronger. It symbolized logic, my greatest tool and ally for making the most out of life so far. But yet, it also proved to be one of my greatest limitations. Logic has been dominating my mental space for the better part of my life, leaving little to space for emotion and communicating with my deeper self and his needs. This was quite evident from my first few therapy sessions. <br/><br/>

Therapy and psychology, on the other hand, symbolize emotion, the true self and the process of being in touch with your true self. [[More]] <br/><br/>

So here I am now. Working in software engineering by day and studying mental health counselling on weekends, hoping to be able one day to sit on the opposite chair. <br/><br/>

I want this blog to be the space where I share my thoughts and feelings as I go along this journey. Talk about burnout from tech, about the progress in my training and what I struggle with. Ideally, I would like to somehow combine these two domains in the future but that's the topic for a much, much bigger discussion. <br/><br/>

I would also like to bring my unique perspective as a individual with inputs from those two, seemingly disparate, fields and maybe spark some novel discussions. Who knows? <br/><br/>
